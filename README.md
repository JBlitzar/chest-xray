Hoping to create a project with the potential for real-world impacts, I built an CNN-based AI pneumonia classifier using the NIH Chest Xray dataset, hoping to gain insights about both the prospects and the potential challenges of using AI for disease flagging. I was able to get 95% training accuracy and 82% validation accuracy. It taught me many things:

Unexpected information can cause spurious correlations and overfitting, so itâ€™s important to make the AI focus on just the chest area. Also, image quality matters, so you need to make sure images are processed in a consistent way.

For my next version, I hope to implement a preprocessing and masking pipeline to focus on only the chest region.

### Project:

AI can effectively and accurately be used to classify radiological images to aid with diagnoses.

### Process:

The first step in any Machine Learning project is to find and prepare a good dataset. For this project, I decided to use the [NIH Chest Xray Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nih-chest-xrays/data). This dataset is great for a couple of reasons:

1. The task itself is well-suited for neural networks: Images that you have to sort into classes.
2. The images themselves are high-resolution and generally normalized.

The code for the dataset loading is in [dataset.py](https://github.com/JBlitzar/chest-xray/blob/main/dataset.py)

Next, I began by creating the training pipeline, located in [trainingmanager.py](https://github.com/JBlitzar/chest-xray/blob/main/trainingmanager.py). This extendable framework allowed me to quickly iterate without wasting my time on the boilerplate code. Within this, we have the metrics we wish to optimize for: In this case, I selected BCELoss, the classic one to use for classification pipelines like this. While initially a lot of work, the effort paid off: a clean OOP system and an accessible API.

Then, I created the architecture. The code for this can be found in [architecture.py](https://github.com/JBlitzar/chest-xray/blob/main/architecture.py). I started with a simple CNN, comparable to the [LeNet architecture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LeNet).
