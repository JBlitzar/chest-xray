pitfalls:

- Looking for spiculated nodules or larger nodules
- Thresholds, not looking for <6mm.
- Soft tissue density, mass density, calification. Dense as bone is benign
- Spiculated border is significant.
- Score of how worrisome.
- Steps: picture of chest xray, cut out center part, stop at diaphram, two dark arches. Take out bone density, subtract out ribs. >1 cm.

- Day 1
  - Got a simple thing up and running from my template, put in dataset and stuff.
  - Inefficient data handling because of spooky pytorch type errors. Saving to a cache instead.
  - Simple CNN with ReLU for now.
  - Used BCELoss, other small tweaks
