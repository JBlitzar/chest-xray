pitfalls:

- Looking for spiculated nodules or larger nodules
- Thresholds, not looking for <6mm.
- Soft tissue density, mass density, calification. Dense as bone is benign
- Spiculated border is significant.
- Score of how worrisome.
- Steps: picture of chest xray, cut out center part, stop at diaphram, two dark arches. Take out bone density, subtract out ribs. >1 cm.
